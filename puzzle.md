PUZZLES

3 OBJECTS PER POTION (POs)

DARK CORRIDOR

Fire spell to see + potion book papers in a skull/drawer

POs: cheese, feather, mouse tail

    • Mirror with objects not present in the ‘real room’. One must grab a jewelry box from the mirror + find the key in a drawer to open it


Inside the box you find 4 gems + you need to insert the gems in the right order inside holes in the wall (blu,orange,green,yellow) – 
CLUE: W(inter)A(utumn)S(pring)S(ummer) written on the floor under a carpet/each wall has pictures of the seasons in the correct order

Once the gems are inserted, a closed drawer opens, and a piece of CHEESE can be taken.

    • In a picture hanging on the wall, the morse code is written. A gramophone on a shelf can be activated and it reproduces the word ‘spell’ using Morse’s code.

The word ‘spell’ must be written on a board (? If it is too difficult, it must be selected among different cards in a drawer and put 
behind the original place of the Morse code picture). A FEATHER is now collectable from another picture.

    • One can find a MOUSE TAIL under a hat in a wardrobe.

    • Potion brewing + mouse transformation + bring two pebbles on a button on the floor to keep the small door open and go in the 
    corridor
   
    • Maze to solve in the form of a mouse. We can see the maze from above when we are in human form and solve it once inside in mouse form

CORRIDOR PART 2/SCENE 2

    • Find the paper with instructions for the Ice Hand and freeze in the correct order some potions (Fire hand needed to reverse the order and try again)

    • There are 8 potions, one for each planet. On the walls, each planet is associated to a number, and each potion has a number/planet associated written in front of it. One must freeze then in the order of the planets from the closest to the furthest from the Sun.

    • The correct execution gives the possibility to turn back to normal whenever the player wants + makes a door appear, passing through which the player is in SCENE 2

NOTE: if one transforms back before passing through the door, they can see CLUES FOR THE NEXT ROOM ON THE WALL (INSTRUCTIONS FOR TELEKINESIS)

SCENE 2

Pos: eye, blue flame, leaf

    • Use telekinesis to attract a key hanging from a vine on top of the lake OR freeze the lake and burn the vine, then take the key

Insert the key in a pillar, and a bush catches fire. Inside the bush there is a light ball. On each pillar there is a letter, that together read ‘INAQUA’, which means you need to put the light ball in the water. Once the player does so, the light transforms in a BLUE FLAME and it can be collected.

    • Find a piece of glass among crystals on a plant, which has inside a dice. At each of the two accessible corners of the room there are two mirror images of a dice. Only one among the four is correct. Place the glass on top of it to make a vine appear. Climb the vine and find an EYE stuck in the wall. Collect it. (OR collectable with telekinesis if seen)

    • Burn a wooden wand floating in the middle on a pedestal + turn the incinerated dust in a button by freezing it.

Press the button, which creates a gust of wind. From then on, some leaves fall from the vines above, coming down from the ceiling, and you have 5 seconds to grab and collect one LEAF. The button can be pushed how many times you want to collect the leaf. (OR the same happens if you throw an ice arrow towards them)

    • Potion brewing + salamander transformation.

    • As a salamander, swim to the borders of the lake to find some gems. At the bottom of the lake, one can see a meridian with a specific direction glowing. Take the STONE in that direction. (OR DO SOMETHING WITH NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST)

    • You then need to cross the lake by swimming and solve a riddle to make a hole appear (ex. What is the instrument that you can use and make noise with but you cannot grab nor touch – voice, use a keyboard to write it), and insert the gem in the hole to open a portal to the next room

ROOM 3

    • You have a table with object on it and 2 drawers: candle, gear wheel, rocks, cristal, pencil, music box. You first have to burn the candle to get a key and use this key to open the left drawer. You get a notebook with on the first page the story of someone like: blablabla, i found a way to change the frequency of magical rocks by making them resonate with spells. blablabla i still have the music box of my daughter blablabla. I want to play it myself. on the second page there is the music box with how to place the gears to repair it and listen to the music, there is also the partition the player has to play (5-8 notes). On the 3rd page you have the crystal with some writtings but not understandable. On the 4th page there are the rocks with differents color, with different wavelenght based on the color of the rock. On the 5th page you have a skull with open mouth and a sentence inside of the mouth like: there is more than meets the eyes. Then you have to repair the music box, then listen to the music, then change the color of the grey rocks into blue and red rocks by using fire hand and ice hand on them. Then you put into contact the crystal and the rocks and try to recreate the melody (reset if nothing touch it in 5 sec). Once the melody is replayed, you unlock the right drawer and gain a skull (the drawer is only slightly open). You can use talk to the dead on the skull and he gives you a riddle you have to solve to open completely the right drawer. You can use the skull as a socket for something, you can use the wax from the candle to make a key from a mold, you can use the last reward from opening the right drawer completely or it is just some lore object.
